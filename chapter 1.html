<p>Isabella Stone, the CEO of the largest diamond company in the USA, woke up early, the sunlight streaming through her tall office windows.</p>
<p>She had a business project to present at the university today. Everything had to be perfect.</p>
<p>Ethan Black, a student at the same university, rushed to class, unaware that destiny would bring him face to face with a CEO.</p>
<p>As Isabella walked through the university hallway, he accidentally bumped into her, papers flying everywhere.</p>
<p>"Oh! I’m so sorry," Ethan said, trying to help gather the scattered files.</p>
<p>Isabella smiled politely. "No worries. Are you a student here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, second-year," Ethan replied nervously.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Selena Stone, Isabella’s jealous step-sister, watched news feeds about Isabella’s achievements, plotting to undermine her.</p>
<p>In a dark university room, Cyra the hacker received secret instructions to scan Isabella’s company database.</p>
<p>Vera, the mafia leader, gathered Luna, Rogue, Shade, and Cyra. "It’s time to assemble. The diamond empire must fall," she said.</p>
