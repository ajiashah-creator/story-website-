<p>Isabella Stone walked through the busy university halls carrying her portfolio, thinking about the presentation she had to deliver.</p>
<p>She didn’t notice Ethan Black rushing in the opposite direction, late for his lecture.</p>
<p>They collided accidentally, papers scattering across the floor.</p>
<p>"Oh! I’m so sorry," Ethan said quickly, bending down to help gather the documents.</p>
<p>Isabella smiled, amused. "No worries. Are you always this clumsy?"</p>
<p>"Not usually," Ethan replied, blushing slightly. "I’m Ethan. Second-year student."</p>
<p>Isabella nodded politely, introducing herself. "I’m Isabella. Visiting for a university project."</p>
<p>They walked together to the lecture hall, talking about the project and exchanging polite conversation.</p>
<p>Little did they know, the Dark Sighters were observing from the shadows, taking notes of her movements.</p>
<p>Luna, the sniper, perched high in a hidden corner, keeping an eye on both Isabella and Ethan.</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade were blending among students, listening carefully to any information that might help their mission.</p>
<p>Cyra, in the computer lab, monitored university networks for digital vulnerabilities, ready to exploit any mistake.</p>
<p>Vera, the Mafia leader, coordinated everyone’s actions through subtle hand signals and gestures.</p>
<p>Selena Stone watched secretly from afar, whispering to herself about how she could use this meeting to her advantage.</p>
<p>Isabella presented her project in the lecture hall, showcasing company strategies, unaware of the lurking danger.</p>
<p>Ethan took notes, fascinated by her intelligence and poise, while the villains noted weaknesses.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, small hints were hidden in the environment: a shadow, a flickering light, a mysterious note.</p>
